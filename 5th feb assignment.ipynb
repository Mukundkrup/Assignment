    "# In object-oriented programming(OOP), a class is a blueprint or template for creating objects. It defines a set of attributes (data members) and methods (member functions) that an object of that class can have. An object, on the other hand, is an instance of a class that has been created and instantiated using the class blueprint. It has own set of values for the data members and can invoke the methods defined in the class.\n",
    "#For example:\n",
    "#consider a class called 'car'. The 'car' class could have attributes such as 'color', 'make' , 'model', 'year', and 'currentspeed'. It could also have methods such as would have its own unique set of values for the attributes (e.g. 'color' = 'red', 'make = \"Toyota\"', 'model = \"Corolla\" ' , 'year = 2022', 'currentSpeed = 0') and can invoke the methods defined in the class (e.g. 'car.accelerate()', 'car.brake()', 'car.turn(\"left\")')\n",
    "#In this example, 'car' is the class and 'car' is the object that has been instantiated from that class. By defining the class onve, you can create multiple objects (e.g. 'car1', 'car2', 'car3', etc.) with the same attributes and methods, but with different values for those attributes. This is one of the main benefits of using OOP - it allows you to create reusable code that can be easily customized to create multiple instances of the same type of object."
