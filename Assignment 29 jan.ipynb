    "\n",
    "6) There are many types of code blocks such as \n",
    "    a) Function : It performs a specific task.\n",
    "    b) Class : It is blue print of creating object.\n",
    "    c) Conditional Statement : It is a block of code which execute only when certaing condition is met.\n",
    "    d) Loop: It is a block of codes that repeat certain number of times or until its condition is met.\n",
    "    etc.\n",
    "    \n",
    "7) # character\n",
    "\n",
    "8) There are several functions:\n",
    "    a) sys.version - This function returns a string containing the version number of the python interpreter.\n",
    "    b) platform.python_version() - This function returns a string containing the version number of the python interpreter with some additional information.\n",
    "    c) platform.python_implemention() - These function return a string containing the  name of the python implementation (eg - \"CPython\", \"Jython\" , etc).\n",
    "    These functions are available in python3.x and will not work on older version.\n",
    "\n",
    "9) lambda\n",

    "10) Preferred installer program.\n",
    "\n",
    "11) print() function\n",
    "    input() function\n",
    "    append()function\n",
    "    insert() function\n",
    "    extend() fuction \n",
    "    type () function\n",
    "    dir() fuction\n",

    "12) An identifier can have a maximum length of 79 characters in Python.\n",
    "\n",
    "13) Benifits of Python :\n",
    "    a) Become Data Science.\n",
    "    b) Scientific and Mathematical computing.\n",
    "    c) web development.\n",
    "    d) Basic Game Devlopment.\n",
    "    e) Security and penetration testing.\n",
    "    \n",
    "14) Python uses a portion of the memory for internal use and non-object memory.\n",
    "\n",
    "15) Python installation on window :\n",
    "    a) Go to www.python.org/downloads/\n",
    "    b) Download python os as per your system requirement \n",
    "    c) click on python released for windows, select the link for latest python 3.\n",
    "    d) Scroll to the bottom select eigther window X86 -64 executable installer for 64-bit or windows X86 executable installer for 32 bit.\n",
    "\n",
    "    \n",
    "16) Indentation refers to the spaces at the beginning of a code line. Where in other programming languages the indentation in code os for readability only, the identation in Python is very important. Python uses indentation to indicate a block of a code.\n"
