    "#Multithreading is useful in various scenarios, such as: -\n",
    "#1.Performing time-consuming or blocking operations:\n",
    "#If you have tasks that involve I/O operations,such as reading from files or making network requests,using threads can prevent your program from being blocked while waiting for these operations to complete. \n",
    "#Other threads can continue executing, making your program more responsive.\n",

    "#On systems with multiple cores or processors, multithreading allows you to take advantage of parallel execution.\n",
